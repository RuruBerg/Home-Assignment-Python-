# Description
This project involves analyzing and visualizing MRI and brain activation data using Python. The main tasks include loading and processing neuroimaging data files, visualizing statistical maps of brain activity, and creating histograms to represent activation patterns. The project utilizes libraries like nibabel for handling NIfTI files, nilearn for brain visualization, and matplotlib for plotting and color mapping.

# Content Table
Anatomical Data: anatomical.nii
Statistical Map Data: olfactory_uniformity-test_z_FDR_0.01.nii
For the analysis, two files were used
* **Functional MRI data**: Contains olfactory brain activation.
* **Structural MRI data**: Contains a high-resolution MRI scan of the human brain's anatomy (used to plot the activation on).

Both files can be easily downloaded from the above-mentioned website, in the sections olfactory: uniformity test, and anatomical.
* Main Notebook: home_assignment.ipynb
